      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm a junior at the University of Iowa, double majoring in Business
        Analytics and Finance. I recently accepted a Business Analytics
        internship at Sammons Financial Group in Des Moines for this upcoming
        summer, and I’m excited to gain real-world experience in the field.
      </p>

      <p>
        I grew up in Johnston, Iowa, and previously worked at Hyperion Field
        Club. College has been an awesome experience — from making new
        connections to discovering more about who I want to be, both personally
        and professionally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fun fact: when I was 12 years old, I played in the Little League World
        Series. It’s an experience I’ll never forget and one that taught me a
        lot about teamwork and perseverance.
      </p>
